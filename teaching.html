                        <b>Instructor of record, Fall 2020</b> (‘Antarctica: the Coolest Continent’, NATSCI 191-01
                        and -02): I
                        designed and taught an introductory course to incoming first-years. This course explored a range
                        of different topics all relating to Antarctic science, for example: the past and future of the
                        ice sheet; basic climate science and its applications; art and culture in Antarctica; the
                        geopolitical setting and history of Antarctic exploration; and how all these factors intertwine
                        with issues of diversity and inclusion in Antarctic science today.
                    </p>
                    <p> For their final projects, I asked students to delve deeper into class material by further
                        exploring a topic relating to Antarctic science through the medium of their choice. This
                        resulted in a variety of creative expressions as students explored their own interests and
                        gained new knowledge and perspectives. With students’ permission, I include some examples below.
                    <ol>
                        <li> “This is a painting of where ice meets the ocean in Antarctica. I especially liked this
                            idea
                            because I did not include any scaling features. This allows for space to imagine how grand
                            this
                            ice wall could be... or how small. Putting the ice in perspective would make it seem like I
                            know
                            more about the intricacies of the ice than I actually do. Its size is completely ambiguous,
                            reflecting the varying expanses and shapes of the continent's features. I wanted to make
                            something that would remind people about how little we know about the space as a whole. I am
                            hoping that this would incite the curiosity of the viewer, which would lead them to make
                            choices
                            for the sake of the ice and scientific discovery. To destroy the ice (by cutting through it
                            with
                            ships to get to oil/trade or indirectly by contributing to global warming in their
                            day-to-day)
                            is to destroy the possibility of gaining knowledge and melting away natural beauty. There
                            are
                            people working very hard to restore natural scapes, but if we can save the land before it is
                            ruined, that can be avoided entirely. Small changes lead to larger ones, so there is always
                            hope
                            for the coming times.”

                            systemic racism in terms of giving unfair and delegitimate credit to people just because of
                            their white skin.”

                            video about Antarctica, focusing on people who knew little about the place or a younger
                            audience. For both demographics, they view Antarctica as mostly just ice and penguins. The
                            message portrayed in my video that there are a lot more biodiversity and geographical
                            diversity to the continent than these people would initially think. By putting together all
                            these separate clips in a short a concise format, it brings that message across quickly and

                        I really enjoyed this class, and it was one of the few that I felt like I wanted to be there and
                        enjoyed learning. I think the small class size and the real interactions we had definitely
                        helped. Thank you
                        <br>
                        This was the one class I looked forward to every week. You were always smiling and eager to
                        interact with us which was so refreshing. I had a tough time this semester with mental health
                        and online school. This class was so amazing, and I hope you continue to spread your joy towards
                        everyone else!
                        <br>
                        This was my favorite class this semester and I really enjoyed this class overall (except the
                        scientific paper lol).
                        <br>
                        I think you did a really good job of teaching as well as providing information that will be of
                        use for us for the rest of our time at UMass, like the campus resources scavenger hunt. I also
                        really liked how you made this class educational but with as little stress as possible for us.
                        You were also very understanding, like when you had us take a break to learn about Zoom fatigue
                        early on when you could tell we were getting burnt out from being in Zoom classes all day.
                        Overall it was a really good semester and thank you very much!
                        <br>
                        I really liked breakout rooms and open communication that was presented in this class. I found
                        that even though we are all learning separate from one another, this class seemed like the most
                        tight knit of all of my classes.
