                <h2> Antarctic Ice Sheet dynamics during the last deglaciation in the Ross Sea</h2>
                <p>During the Last Glacial Maximum, ~20,000 years ago, the Antarctic Ice Sheet was much larger and
                    thicker than today, and extended to the continental shelf break in many places before receding
                    to
                    the modern configuration. Glacial landforms and sediments associated with ice advance and
                    retreat
                    are preserved on the seafloor. These features tell us that within the Ross Sea, ice-sheet
                    retreat
                    was influenced by regional topography and seafloor geology (Halberstadt et al., 2016 [link]), as
                    well as subglacial meltwater (Simkins et al., 2017 [link]) and properties of the unconsolidated
                    sediment underlying ice streams (Halberstadt et al., 2018 [link]).</p>

                    the

                    marks
                    a relative step in grounding-line retreat, starting with the Last Glacial Maximum (blue) and
                    ending
                    with ice pinned on banks (red). Prothro et al. (2020) use radiocarbon dating of seafloor

                    use ice-sheet modeling to explore the impact of seafloor topography on Ross Sea deglacial

                    I am currently working on comparing high-resolution ice-sheet model output with a wealth of

                    data from this region to assess both ice-sheet behavior and model performance. ** VIDEO** Read

                <h2>High-resolution nested Antarctic Ice Sheet modeling to reconcile marine and terrestrial geologic data (NSF OPP Postdoctoral Research Fellowship)
                </h2>
                <p>I will continue to explore deglacial ice-sheet dynamics during my postdoctoral fellowship at <a href="https://www.bgc.org/" target="_blank">Berkeley
                    Geochronology Center</a> with</br> <a href="http://noblegas.berkeley.edu/~balcs/" target="_blank">Dr. Greg Balco</a>
                    beginning in Jan 2022. Here&rsquo;s a description of the project: High-resolution nested
                    Antarctic
                    Ice
                    Sheet modeling to reconcile marine and terrestrial geologic data (NSF OPP Postdoctoral
                    Research
                    Fellowship)</p>

                <p>This work integrates both marine and terrestrial geologic datasets with numerical simulations
                    to
                    investigate Antarctic Ice Sheet behavior (and contribution to global sea level) throughout
                    the last
                    deglaciation, ~20,000 years ago until present. Specifically, this research will address two
                    issues
                    regarding the relationship between simulations and data and their use in reconstructing past
                    ice-sheet
                    behavior: 
                    <ol style="margin-left:15px;">
                    <li>Geologic records from the modern seafloor suggest significantly earlier retreat of
                    marine-based ice compared to terrestrial records of mountain peak exposure (ice thinning).
                    Computerexperiments investigate several hypotheses for this mismatch in timing. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Exposure age data
                    (terrestrial
                    measurements recording ice elevation changes) are often interpreted to reflect ice dynamics
                    hundreds
                    of
                    kilometers away from the study site. This work uses simulations to explore the linkage
                    between ice
                    elevation changes &lsquo;upstream&rsquo; as glaciers flow through mountainous regions and
                    ice
                    dynamics
                    further &lsquo;downstream&rsquo; where ice contacts the ocean..
                </li></ol></p>

                <p>Comparison between model simulations and exposure age data is improved through
                    high-resolution nested
                    ice
                    sheet modeling, which provide unprecedented context for exposure age data generally located
                    in
                    regions
                    of complex topography.</p>
